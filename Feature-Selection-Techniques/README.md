# Feature-Selection-Technique

 it  is  dimensionality Reduction Technique.
 
 Feature Selection is one of the core concepts in machine learning which hugely impacts the performance of your model. 
 The data features that you use to train your machine learning models have a huge influence on the performance you can achieve.



Irrelevant or partially relevant features can negatively impact model performance.



Feature selection and Data cleaning should be the first and most important step of your model designing.



Feature Selection is the process where you automatically or manually select those features which contribute most to your prediction variable or output in which you are interested in.





Having irrelevant features in your data can decrease the accuracy of the models and make your model learn based on irrelevant features.


### How to select features and what are Benefits of performing feature selection before modeling your data?
· Reduces Overfitting: Less redundant data means less opportunity to make decisions based on noise.


· Improves Accuracy: Less misleading data means modeling accuracy improves.



· Reduces Training Time: fewer data points reduce algorithm complexity and algorithms train faster.
