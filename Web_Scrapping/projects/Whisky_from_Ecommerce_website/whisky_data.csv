"Karuizawa 1981
Sherry Cask #6056",no rating,,"An incredibly intense 1981 vintage bottling from cult closed Japanese distillery Karuizawa. Aged in a sherry cask for more than 30 years, this is another excellent example from this legendary distillery – it might just be the best one that we've bottled.

"Karuizawa 1972
Cask #7290 Bot 2008",no rating,,"The follow-up to last year's phenomenal 1971 vintage Karuizawa, which swept all before it. Interest in this has been predictably huge.","£8,500"
"Karuizawa 1984
29 Years Old Sherry Cask #3662",no rating,,"This sherry-matured Karuizawa was a joint bottling between The Whisky Exchange and Japanese company Shinanoya. Distilled in 1984 and aged for 29 years, 271 bottles were produced at 61%.","£8,500"
"Karuizawa 30 Year Old
Bourbon Cask #8606",no rating,,"A contrast to its companion 31yo sherried release, this Karuizawa 30 year old has been matured solely in bourbon casks. A break from the distillery's usual character and one of only a handful of similar releases – intense and showing another side of this closed, cult distillery.","£8,500"
"Karuizawa 1984

First Fill Sherry Cask #4021",no rating,,"Another enormously potent first fill sherry cask from Karuizawa, this was distilled in 1984 and displays very big earthy savoury notes, overcooked Dundee cake, leathery fruit and a hint of smoke. At 64.5% a drop of water (or four) is perfectly acceptable, but we actually preferred this one neat.

"Karuizawa 1980
Bot.2015",no rating,,"Previewed at The Whisky Exchange Whisky Show 2015 as a Dream Dram, Karuizawa 1980 The Golden Samurai is one of the finest examples of sherry-cask-matured Japanese whisky we have ever tried. Bottled from a single cask, there are only a very limited number of bottles available.","£9,000"
"Karuizawa 1976 Noh
32 Year Old Sherry Butt #6719",no rating,,"Another of the famous 'Noh' bottlings of Karuizawa featuring traditional Japanese theatre costumes on the label. This is a sherry butt from the 1976 vintage, bottled at a staggering 63% at 32 years old. This went very quickly.

"Karuizawa 38 Year Old
Pearl Geisha",no rating,,"Bottled by Elixir Distillers, this 38-year-old Karuizawa single malt is currently the oldest whisky in the prestigious Geisha series.


One half of the exquisite Pearl Geisha duo, this was aged in sherry cask no. 4348 and filled into just 172 bottles at 62.1% ABV.


The Geisha series was created to pay homage to both the exquisite whiskies of the closed Karuizawa distillery, and the majesty of its surrounding culture. As with the rest of the series, the Pearl Geisha labels were designed by The Whisky Exchange’s creative director Raj Chavda, who is also a fellow of the Royal Society of Art.","£20,000"
"Karuizawa 1967
42 Year Old Cask #6426 TWE 10th Anniversary",no rating,,"Here it is - the legendary Karuizawa 1967 42yo from cask 6426. The oldest and most famous Karuizawa ever bottled when it appeared at the tail-end of 2009, we only ever had around 200 bottles of this one, and after Whiskyfun and Whiskynotes both gave it humungous 95 point scores, it sold out in a little over 24 hours.

"Hanyu 1990
Queen of Hearts Cask #9102",no rating,,"One of a series of really terrific Japanese malts from the sadly now defunct Hanyu distillery. Bursting with character and complexity, these masterpieces from a 'lost' distillery are pricey, but well worth it. A massive hit at this year's Whisky Live.
