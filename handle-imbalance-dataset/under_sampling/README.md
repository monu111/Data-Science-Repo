# Under Sampling :
Randomly eleminates Majority class instances/records until it balance with the Minority class Disadvantage: As it eleminates randomly there is a possibility of elemination of USEFUL DATA thus making the algorithm predicts inaccurately


NearMiss is an under-sampling technique. It aims to balance class distribution by randomly eliminating majority class examples. When instances of two different classes are very close to each other, we remove the instances of the majority class to increase the spaces between the two classes. This helps in the classification process.
